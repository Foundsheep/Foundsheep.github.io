    <h3>Hello, I'm DeokJong(a.k.a DJ) Moon</h3>
    <p>
      For anyone who knows of Harry Potter, I'm like Prof. Severus Snape. I'm quite a cynical person and give critical opinions very often. However, the advices and thoughts I give to the organisation I belong to tend to be relativly trustworthy and of sincere thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help Harry, Severus eventually loses his life like Prof. Albus Dumbledore. They both accomplished their tasks to make the ultimate victory, but in a different way. I think Severus would have become generous and warm-hearted like Albus, if he remained in his life and got mature by an unexpected love encountered in the future. I hope oneday I'll become like Albus and not give just critically important thoughts, but also generously embrace things going on around me :)
    </p>
    {/* <p>
      To know the Creator of the universe and to live according to His original scheme, which I believe is to enjoy this life in harmony with others, is one of the greatest goals I have for my daily life :).
