    <h1>Hello, I'm DJ Moon</h1>

      For anyone who knows of Harry Potter, I'm like Prof. Severus Snape. I'm quite a cynical person and by appearance, I seem to not trust almost anyone else. However, the advices and thoughts I give to discussions tend to be relativly trustworthy and of sincere thoughts.
      To help Harry, he eventually loses his life like Prof. Albus Dumbledore. They both did their job to make the ultimate good win, but in a different way. I think Severus would have become more like Albus, if he continued his life after the final win. I hope I'll be oneday like Albus and have a more heart-warming charcter

      To know the Creator of the universe and to live according to His original scheme, which I believe is to enjoy this life in harmony with others, is one of the greatest goals I have for my daily life :).
      Also, below is the list of my philosophy as a developer I've got for the tasks and how I treat them.
