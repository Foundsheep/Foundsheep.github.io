    <h3>Hello, I'm DeokJong(a.k.a DJ) Moon. <br />
      Let me tell you about myself with a bit of touching story.</h3>
    {/* <p>Let me tell you about myself with a bit of touching story :)</p> */}
    <p>
      For anyone who knows of the Harry Potter series, I'm like Prof. Severus Snape. I seem quite cynical and often give critical opinions (no worries for hurting the listeners, since I wouldn't say I like it). However, the advice and thoughts I suggest to my group are quite often found to be trustworthy and of sincere thoughts.

      To help Harry, Severus eventually loses his life as Prof. Albus Dumbledore does. I interpret it as both advocates accomplishing their tasks to make the ultimate victory but in different ways. I think Severus would have become more generous and warm-hearted like Albus if he remained in his life and matured by an unexpected love encountered in the future after the victory. I dream of becoming like Albus one day, generously embracing and leading people under my care, and the warmth of love sprouting from within me making good fruits in my organisation :)

      To know the Creator of the universe and to live according to His original scheme, which I believe is to enjoy this life in harmony with others, is one of the greatest goals I have for my daily life :).
