    <h3>Hello, I'm DeokJong(a.k.a DJ) Moon. <br />
      Let me tell you about myself with a bit of storytelling.</h3>
    <p>
      For anyone who knows of Harry Potter, I'm like Prof. Severus Snape. I often give critical opinions and seem very disintersted and neutral when it comes to relationships(no worries about hurting anyone, since I hate it). At the end of the story, Severus eventually loses his life to help Harry as Prof. Albus Dumbledore does. I interpret this as both advocates accomplishing their tasks to achieve the ultimate victory but in different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, I serve my organisation with a sense of great magnitude and try to be a member of trust despite being seen as cynical. I think Severus would have become more generous and warm-hearted like Albus if he remained in his life and matured by an unexpected love encountered in the future after the victory. I dream of becoming like Albus one day, generously embracing and leading people under my care, and the warmth of love sprouting from within me making good fruits in my organisation :)
    </p>
    {/* <p>
      To know the Creator of the universe and to live according to His original scheme, which I believe is to enjoy this life in harmony with others, is one of the greatest goals I have for my daily life :).
    </p> */}
