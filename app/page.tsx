    <h1>Hello, I'm DJ Moon</h1>
    <p>Thanks for visiting my website :)
      I believe everyday is a great day and deserves to be enjoyed fully by all of us! 
      One of the reasons I live for is to learn how to be happy 
      so that I could pass that wisdom on to my children.</p>
    <p>Below are my philosophy as a developer</p>
