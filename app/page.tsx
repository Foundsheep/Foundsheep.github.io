      Let me tell you about myself with a short analogy.</h3>
    <p>
      For anyone who knows of Harry Potter, I'm like Prof. Severus Snape. I often give critical opinions and seem very sharp and interested in nothing but work(no worries about hurting anyone, since I hate it). At the end of the story, Severus eventually loses his life to help Harry as Prof. Albus Dumbledore does. I interpret this as both advocates accomplishing their tasks to achieve the ultimate victory in respectively different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, I serve my organisation with a sense of great magnitude and try to be a member of trust despite being seen as cynical. I think Severus would have become more generous and warm-hearted like Albus if he remained in his life and matured by an unexpected love encountered in the future after the victory. I dream of becoming like Albus one day, generously embracing and leading people under my care, and the warmth of love sprouting from within me to produce good fruits in my organisation :)

    <h3>Hey there, thanks for coming :)<br />I'm DeokJong Moon</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm a hedonist, a pursuer of true happiness. Especially, I take care of the happiness at work tremendously, and here is what I've concluded thus far.</p>
    <p>After having experienced several startups, colleagues and industries, I've concluded that leaders and colleagues I work with in the organisation matter a lot to my happiness at work. Their truthfulness, honesty and integrity were a key to the health of my organisation and the quality of the outcomes of my projects, no matter how hard I tried to keep it high. So, what am I trying to say? I really, really desire to meet good leaders and colleagues. However, one thing I've also realised is that there is none like that, and neither am I.</p>
    <p>Hence, I want to make one thing very clear here. Neither you, nor I are good enough to achieve the ultimate happiness I dream of at work. However, what I'm and will be trying is to embrace our imperfections and remember the higher values that point us to that happiness. I believe this will bring me there one day in the future. This is what life is all about... So let's keep dancing through life :)</p>
