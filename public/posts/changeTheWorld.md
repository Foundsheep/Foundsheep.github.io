# Change the world

#### Date : 28.Mar.2025

It was just a few weeks ago that I started feeling seriously that I needed to change the world, if not possibly the whole world, then at least my own. Otherwise, I knew I would see what I believed in or dreamt of would not happen in this world.

Thus, I took it very seriously that I must be the one who takes the initiative, and this will commence from my family to the church I belong to and to my workplace. I'll take care of my garden of dreams myself.

So, I'm going to write a drama. Let's see how this would turn up. As someone said, "Nobody in all of Oz, no wizard that there is or was, is ever going to bring me down."
