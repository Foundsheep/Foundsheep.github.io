# Purpose of Science

#### Date : 19.Aug.2025

I'm learning many new things these days thanks to my MSc study. The course includes mathematics and its application as a scientific way of revealing something from data.

This is, actually, the point I got strucked with and want to tell now. Actually, when I ponder upon all those theorems and findings in the science, they are literally discovering some things. They seem like new theories, but the point is they all have existed from the beginning of this universe. So, if you can see the science from this perspective, what it is doing becomes exploring the nature and establishing its rules and characteristics in human terms.

This view, perhaps, may be well spread among the scientists. However, it was something new to me as a junior scientist, and this got me more convinced and intrigued about the role of God in all we do.

Scientists discover the rules of the nature. Engineers apply those rules to the products, and we live upon them. Thus, we can see all our endeavours are the efforts to understand what He has created in the beginning, and following the hidden tide under the creation gives us a way to live happily on this earth.
