# Staying in the SJSM church

#### Date : 19.Aug.2025

I've come to this place to tidy up my mind and organise my thoughts that were dynamically reshaped last night.

Last night, I and my family met my beloved Pastor Seo and his wife. Apparently, because of the things happening currently in my church, we talked about the matter, and one of the things he mentioned to me is to stay in this church no matter what.

It was, of course, what I had always been hearing from him and, therefore, no surprise to me. However, what struck my heart was his determinedness and certainty towards God's help on us. He was very sure that He would help us if we pray, and it was not a theoretical advice, but more like his first principle he's gone to and relied upon all the time.

Will it surely happen, if I pray? Actually, my tears were almost about to burst out, when he told us his thoughts and hearts for us. He was very determined to pray for our church that many times he mentioned we should pray weeping. I can tell, to be honest, that I was almost weeping in my heart. I was deeply moved by his telling, and came up with a thought, 'Okay, whether it's going to really happen or not, He would listen to my prayer and it is not something stupid. Actualy, this might be the time to, truly, rely on Him and demonstrate His teaching for us'.

Right now, I can't express better about how I was deeply moved last night and determined for something I dream of. I'm going to pray for my church, as if it deserves all my love, and stay here, as if it cannot be apart from me like my family.
